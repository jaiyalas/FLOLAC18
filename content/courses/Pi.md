## Aims

+ To learn a basic process algebra (mobility and communication via the pi-calculus)
+ To learn a basic semantics of the pi-calculus
+ To learn a basic type theory of the pi-calculus (session types)
+ To learn applications of the pi-calculus (protocols, distributed and concurrent languages based on communications)

## Learning outcomes

Students can learn basic mathematics behind process algebra and know its application areas.

## Syllabus

To describe process models for specifying and verifying concurrent systems.
In particular, to focus on the pi-calculus, which provides communication via message passing.
Calculi for mobility and its applications: mobility via message passing, the pi-calculus, expressiveness, session types, distributed mobility and applications to protocol verifications, and programming languages.
